# My dotfiles
This is where I store all of my .dotfiles:
* **.vimrc** (my vim editor configuration file)
* **.bashrc** (top hierarchy bash config file, it sources every other bash configuration file)
* **.bash_prompt** (used to customize my bash prompt)
* **.aliases** (used for certain shortcuts and mappings I normally use)
* **.exports** (used to export certain bash variables like default editor etc.)
* **.env_project** (used for project specific exports)

I am creating this repo so I that can easily setup my customized Ubuntu Linux system
on different work-stationes as a part of the embedded Linux system course on my university. 

It is evolving at the speed of light. :)
