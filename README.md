# My dotfiles
This is where I store all of my .dotfiles like:
* **.vimrc**
* **.bashrc**
* **.bash_prompt**
* **.aliases**
* **.exports**

I am creating this repo so I can easily setup my customized Ubuntu Linux system
on different work-stationes as a part of the embedded Linux system course on my university. 

It is evolving at the speed of light. :)
